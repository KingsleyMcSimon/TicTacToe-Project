# Name Of Project:
TicTacToe Game.

# Project Description:
The TicTacToe game is a game played by two humans. It's board is a 3 X 3 grid and players alternate turns until one player is victorious or the game ends in a draw. Players win by securing three consecutive positions on a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends in a tie if neither player has won and all position on the board are taken.

# How To Play The Game:
Draw the board - first, you draw the board which is made up of a 3 X 3 grid squares.

Have the first player go first - although traditionally, the first player goes with X, the first player can be allowed to go with either X or O.

Have the second player go second with his or her own symbol either X or O.

Keep alternating moves until one of the players has drawn a row of three symbols or until no one can win.

Keep practicing to become good at playing the game.
