# About The Project/Game:

The TicTacToe game (American English) is all about learning the concept of the minimax algorithm that is widely and successfully used across the fields like Artificial Intelligence, Economics, Game Theory, Statistics or even Philosophy. 

The game also known as noughts and cross (British English) or Xs and Os is a paper and pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns making the spaces in a 3 X 3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

The TicTacToe game is also played by two humans. It's board is a 3 X 3 grid and players alternate turns until one player is victorious or the game ends in a draw. Players win by securing three consecutive positions on a row, column, or diagonal. The game ends in a tie if neither player has won and all position on the board are taken.

# Built With:
